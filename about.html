            Coen de Vente is a postdoctoral researcher in the Quantitative Healthcare Analysis (qurAI) group at the Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam, and the Amsterdam University Medical Center.
            <br><br>
            He completed his MSc in Biomedical Engineering (cum laude) at Eindhoven University of Technology, following the Medical Imaging track. His graduation project focused on automated prostate cancer detection and grading from MRI.
            <br><br>
            In September 2019, he started as a PhD student at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, under the supervision of Clarisa SÃ¡nchez and Bram van Ginneken. He worked on developing deep learning techniques for the analysis of retinal diseases using optical coherence tomography and color fundus imaging, as well as on the development of CORADS-AI, a deep learning system for the assessment of COVID-19 in chest CT. Since June 2021, he continued his PhD on the same project and supervision team in the Eye Lab of the qurAI group.
            <br><br>
            Since January 2024, he has been a postdoctoral researcher in the qurAI group. His research aims to bring AI for medical imaging closer to real-world use by focusing on model robustness through uncertainty estimation, generative modeling, and efficient annotation, primarily in ophthalmology and thorax-abdomen computed tomography imaging.
