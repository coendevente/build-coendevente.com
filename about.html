Coen de Vente completed his MSc in Biomedical Engineering (cum laude) at Eindhoven University of Technology, following the Medical Imaging track. His graduation project focused on automated prostate cancer detection and grading from MRI.
<br><br>
He obtained his PhD degree in 2025 under the supervision of Clarisa Sánchez and Bram van Ginneken. He worked on his thesis in the <a href="https://diagnijmegen.nl/">DIAG</a> group at Radboudumc, Nijmegen, and the <a href="https://qurai.amsterdam/">Eye Lab</a> of the qurAI group at the University of Amsterdam. His <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/5bb41ff3-80eb-4abb-b499-4117a53bc011">thesis</a>, entitled “Towards Robust Deep Learning for Medical Imaging: Applications in Ophthalmology and Radiology”, focused on improving the robustness of deep learning techniques for the analysis of retinal diseases using optical coherence tomography and color fundus imaging, as well as for the assessment of COVID-19 in chest computed tomography (CT).
<br><br>
He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the qurAI group. His research aims to bring AI for medical imaging closer to real-world use by focusing on model robustness through uncertainty estimation, generative modeling, and efficient annotation, primarily in ophthalmology and radiology.
